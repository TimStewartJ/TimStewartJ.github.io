            <main>
                <p>
                    I found this user test to be incredibly helpful. When making
                    anything that ultimately goes into a user's hands, it's too
                    easy to get caught up in one's own design. Seeing how other
                    people interacted with and used my site was eye-opening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing I noticed right off the bat was users' confusion
                    with the phrase to try hovering over the numbers. This is
                    because the numbers are not initially visible. The user has
                    to first take off the cover. This makes me consider the text
                    I have under the title and potentially switching the default
                    to be covers off instead.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Users also tended to try to click the remove cover button on
                    the second image, even though the button was clearly
                    disabled. I'll have to experiment with other methods of
                    making it more obvious that there is no cover to take off
                    for that particular perspective.
                </p>

                        disabled.

                    Some other smaller comments I received were mentions of
                    smaller improvments that could be made. One user said that
                    they didn't even see the text under the title, even though
                    it is a relatively important instruction. They said the
                    large image draws the eyes from it. I could perhaps try
                    using an overlay upon initial loading of the site, serving
                    as both a welcome and a loading screen for all of the
                    images.
