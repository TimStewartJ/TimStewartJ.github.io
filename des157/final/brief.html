                <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                <p>
                    For the final project, I hope to expand on the every picture
                    studio through more interaction and expanded visuals.
                </p>
                <h3>Comparison 1</h3>
                <p>

                    captures a lot of what I want to accomplish for the final.
                    Scrolling through the site, the gun is taken apart and its
                    insides are revealed. I want to offer that same level of
                    exposure for my PC and how that is revealed. One thing to
                    note is that the site seems to use a video for the graphics.
                    Because it scrubs through the video as the user scrolls, it
                    gives off a choppy effect. A picture of the site is shown
                    below.

                    also embodies a bit of what I want to accomplish. This
                    interactive experience allows the user to go through and
                    explore their data center, roughly similar to what I want my
                    users to experience when going through my PC. Microsoft's
                    site does take a bit to load and is fairly hard to run since
                    it involves high-quality 3D visualizations. While that would
                    be cool to implement for my project, it isn't feasible and
                    I'll likely be sticking to the two dimensional format.

                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    My specific goal is to implement more moving parts. Right
                    now, the site is awfully static. Similar to the New York
                    Times article, I want for there be a sense of depth and
                    technicality.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    I don't have too much in mind for changing the actual
                    underlying design. I'm quite content with the font and color
                    choice and how that all comes together. I might try to add
                    more sleek-ness by eliminating round corners and bezels, but
                    that is not something I've decided yet.
                </p>
                <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
                <p>
                    I've decided that this will be my main area of focus for the
                    project. My initial thoughts were to manipulate the images I
                    have even more. Perhaps I'll layer the elements of the PC
                    further and incorporate a parallax effect. I would also like
                    to have the specific parts clickable to pull up more details
                    and information on them.
                </p>
                <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    With this project, I want the audience to see what example
                    is inside of the magic boxes that we use every day for
                    nearly everything. I also hope to simplify what's inside of
                    a computer for the audience and show that it isn't
                    necessarily a super complex thing.
                </p>
