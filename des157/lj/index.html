                        Out of the two articles offered as options, I opted for
                        the
                        <a
                            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/overuse-of-overlays/"

                        >, by Kathryn Whitenton of the Nielson Norman Group. I
                        had previously encountered one of their articles from
                        the last Learning Journal, so I knew what I would read
                        would be good. I found the fact that it provided clear
                        guidelines to follow very neat. As I kept reading,
                        however, I came to the realization that there are
                        probably hundreds of clear, objective guidelines to
                        follow in regards to usability on the web. How could
                        anyone ever keep track of all of them and stay within
                        them at all times? I thought perhaps there could be a
                        single, giant resource with everything one needs to know
                        about UX on it. As I went over different ideas and
                        scenarios in my head, an even simpler solution presented
                        itself. Surely, practice would engrain these concepts
                        far better than any book or article can. Only time will
                        tell...

                        Anything a user has to interact with needs special
                        consideration and care when being designed. This is
                        especially true for forms, where a user can provide
                        valuable input. Personally, form design is something
                        I've always struggled with. I'm never quite sure of how
                        to make the best form, even though they're incredibly
                        vital to most projects I work on. Because of this, I
                        found the
                        <a
                            href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"
                            >article provided</a
                        >
                        to be very helpful. It gives actionable and objective
                        guidelines to follow that makes it really easy to create
                        a well-designed form. One thing I found interesting was
                        the comments on the article. In particular, a user
                        points out that NN group's article on
                        <a
                            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/"
                            >"Marking Required Fields in Forms"</a
                        >
                        contradicts point 5 in the UX Collective's article. I
                        think that explicitly stating which form fields are
                        required is a good thing, but I'll definitely experiment
                        around with it to find the option that works best for
                        me.
