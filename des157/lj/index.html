                        This week we read a pretty
                        <a
                            href="https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099"

                        >
                        on game UX/UI design. To be completely honest, I felt a
                        little uneasy reading the article. There a was implicit
                        focus on taking advantage of low-level human desires and
                        stimuli. As a result of this, it seemed like there was
                        an almost predatory focus on the market of mobile games
                        for children. Unfortunately, this is the way that mobile
                        game design would head toward anyway, and is ultimately
                        inevitable. The guidelines themselves seem simple
                        enough. They focus on taking a step back and thinking
                        about what the average person would do when given a
                        certain design element and how to engineer that for what
                        we, as the designers, want.

                        Shown above is a picture of my PC. I've had it for many
                        many years, but throughout those years it has taken
                        different forms. I like to think of it as my own
                        personal ship of Theseus. Every single part has been
                        exchanged at one time or another since I first built it
                        sometime in middle school. Is it still the same PC?
                        Thought experiments aside, its a tool that I use so
                        often that I've put it into a case that I can take with
                        me anywhere. I hope that in my studio project, I can
                        find a way to do justice to my PC and showcase its
                        current parts in a way that anyone could understand.

                        This week, I explored the website
                        <a href="https://howmanyplants.com/">How Many Plants</a
                        >. What stood out to me the most was its striking
                        display on the homepage. The shelves have various books
                        and plants arranged in a manner that is aesthetically
                        pleasing and allows for the greenery to stand out. Aside
                        from this, I found the interaction pleasing. It really
                        brings the focus to the plants when you're able to hover
                        over them and cause an animation to play. I expected a
                        little more interaction if I clicked on a plant, so it
                        was jarring when nothing happened. It is definitely
                        something that I would've liked to see. Overall, this
                        site showcases great usage of images to portray the bond
                        and care humans have for plants, and I certainly hope to
                        similarly provide such a communicative user experience.

                        Out of the two articles offered as options, I opted for
                        the
                        <a

                        >, by Kathryn Whitenton of the Nielson Norman Group. I
                        had previously encountered one of their articles from
                        the last Learning Journal, so I knew what I would read
                        would be good. I found the fact that it provided clear
                        guidelines to follow very neat. As I kept reading,
                        however, I came to the realization that there are
                        probably hundreds of clear, objective guidelines to
                        follow in regards to usability on the web. How could
                        anyone ever keep track of all of them and stay within
                        them at all times? I thought perhaps there could be a
                        single, giant resource with everything one needs to know
                        about UX on it. As I went over different ideas and
                        scenarios in my head, an even simpler solution presented
                        itself. Surely, practice would engrain these concepts
                        far better than any book or article can. Only time will
                        tell...

                        Anything a user has to interact with needs special
                        consideration and care when being designed. This is
                        especially true for forms, where a user can provide
                        valuable input. Personally, form design is something
                        I've always struggled with. I'm never quite sure of how
                        to make the best form, even though they're incredibly
                        vital to most projects I work on. Because of this, I
                        found the
                        <a
                            href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f"
                            >article provided</a
                        >
                        to be very helpful. It gives actionable and objective
                        guidelines to follow that makes it really easy to create
                        a well-designed form. One thing I found interesting was
                        the comments on the article. In particular, a user
                        points out that NN group's article on
                        <a
                            href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/"
                            >"Marking Required Fields in Forms"</a
                        >
                        contradicts point 5 in the UX Collective's article. I
                        think that explicitly stating which form fields are
                        required is a good thing, but I'll definitely experiment
                        around with it to find the option that works best for
                        me.
